# Proveably Random Raffle Contracts

## About
This code is to create a Proveably Random smart contract lottery

## what we want to do 
- users should be able to enter the raffle by paying for a ticket. The ticket fees are going to be the prize the winner receives
- the lottery should automatically and programatically draw a winner after a certain period 
- chainlink vrf should  generate a provably random number 
- chainlink automation should trigger the lottery draw regularly

## Tests
- wtite deploy scripts
- write tests
    local chain
    forked testnet
    forked mainnet
